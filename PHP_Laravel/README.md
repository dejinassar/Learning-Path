# PHP & Laravel Learning Path

## Overview
This phase covers the basics of PHP and dives into Laravel, a popular web framework. The goal is to understand PHP syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Laravelâ€™s MVC architecture to build modern web applications.

### Topics Covered:

2. **Object-Oriented PHP**: Classes, objects, and inheritance.
3. **Introduction to Laravel**: MVC, routing, middleware, and Eloquent ORM.
4. **RESTful APIs**: How to build and structure RESTful APIs in Laravel.

### Weekly Breakdown:
- **Week 1**: PHP fundamentals, mini-project: PHP-based contact form.
- **Week 2**: Laravel basics, mini-project: Blog application.
- **Week 3**: Advanced Laravel (Eloquent ORM, APIs), mini-project: Task management API.

### Mini-Projects:
1. **Contact Form**: A simple PHP-based contact form with validation.
2. **Blog Application**: Built using Laravel with user authentication and CRUD functionality.
3. **Task Management API**: RESTful API using Laravel, demonstrating database interactions.
4. **E-Commerce Platform**: Implement authentication, cart features, and payment integration.

### Reflections
- You can find my daily reflections and code for each topic in the respective week folders.

**Next Steps**: I plan to continue improving my Laravel skills by building more complex APIs and incorporating advanced authentication mechanisms.
