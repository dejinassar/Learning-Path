# Week 1: PHP Basics

## Overview:
In this week, I focused on understanding the basics of PHP, including syntax, control structures, and functions. I also worked on a mini-project: a simple contact form.

### Daily Breakdown:
- **Day 1**: Learned about PHP syntax, variables, and data types.
- **Day 2**: Explored control structures like `if`, `switch`, and loops.
- **Day 3**: Functions in PHP—how to define, call, and pass arguments.
- **Day 4**: Arrays and array functions in PHP.
- **Day 5**: Worked on forms and form validation in PHP.
- **Day 6**: Learnt about OOP concepts in php.
- **Day 7**: Error handling in PHP.
- **Day 8**: Built a mini-project: Contact Form.

### Mini-Project: Contact Form
- **Goal**: Build a simple contact form in PHP with validation.
- **Technologies**: PHP, HTML, CSS.
- **Reflection**: This project helped reinforce my understanding of PHP’s form-handling and validation mechanisms. 


### Features:
- **Form Handling**: User inputs are captured using PHP and validated.
- **Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled, email is valid, and proper error messages are displayed.
- **Security**: Basic sanitation of inputs to prevent XSS attacks.

### Technologies:
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting for form handling.
- **HTML & CSS**: Front-end for form design and layout.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the PHP project on your local server (e.g., using XAMPP or MAMP).
3. Access the form via `localhost/PHP_Laravel/Week1_Basics/contact.php`.

### Future Improvements:
- Add a feature to store the form data in a database.
- Improve the styling and form validation with JavaScript.

### Challenges:
- I struggled a bit with understanding how PHP handles error messages during form validation, but after reviewing the documentation, I was able to resolve it.

## Next Steps:
In Week 2, I will dive into Laravel and focus on building my first Laravel project.
